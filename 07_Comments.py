# 7. lesson - Comments
# comment in MacOs - cmd + / on marked text
# comment out the text which you do not want to print 
# print("Hello world") 
# no output!

# Use: for security, to remind yourself of the function of the code
# E.g. Using "" because this string contains ''
# print("It's a small world after all")

# Other occasions to use comments:
# to explain the code to the others
# for debugging - commenting out the code line by line and trying to print
#               - to see where the error occurrs

# 8. lesson - How to use comments

# This line of code does nothing

# Try to print line 21, it will give you an error
print('Hello it's a small world after all')

# Line 21 will not work because there already is a single quote inside the string
# Comment out the line 21 by cmd + / for MacOs, and by ctrl + KC for Windows

# Try to uncomment the line 28 by cmd + / for MacOs, and by ctrl + KU
# print it, this one with double quotes will work
# print("Hello it's a small world after all")
